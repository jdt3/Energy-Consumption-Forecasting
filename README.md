# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting
This project analyzes historical energy consumption data to forecast future usage and provide actionable insights. It showcases my proficiency in time series analysis, machine learning, and interactive dashboard development.

# Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of energy consumption data (AEP dataset) and applies forecasting techniques to predict future usage. Key components include:

Data Analysis & Forecasting:
Exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing (resampling hourly data into daily averages), and forecasting using Python and Prophet. Model performance is evaluated with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

Interactive Dashboard:
An interactive dashboard built with Plotly Dash that lets users adjust the forecast horizon and view both historical and forecasted consumption data along with confidence intervals.

Data Integration & Reporting:
The project also demonstrates the use of SQL for data transformation and Power BI for advanced reporting and visualization.

# Features
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Understand trends, seasonality, and anomalies in energy consumption.

Time Series Forecasting:
Utilize Prophet to forecast future energy usage based on historical data.

Interactive Visualization:
An interactive dashboard allows users to dynamically select forecast horizons and explore prediction intervals.
